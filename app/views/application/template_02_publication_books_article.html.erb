      <p>The aim of The TJL Monograph Series and Book Series is to aid linguists in Taiwan make research findings available to a wider domestic and international readership. Researchers in academic fields in Taiwan are frequently forced to resort to the unprofessional practice of ‘self-publishing’, especially for presentation of a major work which may be submitted in application for promotion. Linguists in Taiwan now have an alternative in that The TJL offers a professional channel for book-length manuscripts to be anonymously peer-reviewed, formally published, and commercially distributed. The same standards that apply to TJL journal articles apply here as well.</p>
